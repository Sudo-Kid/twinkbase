Twinkbase
=========

This is a website that hold a database of items from the game World Of Warcraft. This database is used to power a tool that will allow you to find your next item upgrade no matter of level.


If you find any coding problems or database problem please let me know and I will do my best to patch them as soon as possable. If you would like to help out and commit please let me know.


Day 2 Updates
=============

We have added more items to the itemdb.json file. This should be any of the missing items from the last pull. I have also added a basic but terrible database. This will require MySQL workbench to view. I will be updating this database before moving further on the project.
